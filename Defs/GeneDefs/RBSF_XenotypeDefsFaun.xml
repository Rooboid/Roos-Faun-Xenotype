		<description>The skittish and mysterious fauns lurk in solitude within the greenest, dreamiest groves of the Rim. Though their bold antlers set them apart from their frisky cousins – the Satyr – but it’s far easier to track down a faun by carefully observing the flora in the vicinity. A sudden bloom in plant-life may indicate the presence of a Faun, but with this, may also indicate that the Faun is ready to use their psychic connection with the earth in self-defence. \n\nFauns are agile, fragile and reluctant to engage in conflict. Despite this, Glitterworld science facilities have been known to vatgrow Fauns for their intelligence and horticultural connection, often dispatching them onto Rimworlds as armour-clad field researchers.</description>
		<descriptionShort>Within the mossy groves of the untouched rim dwell the fauns; a humanoid relative of the deer that possessess a range of cervine traits, such as unique facial markings, bashful personalities and, most prominently, the majestic antlers atop their heads.</descriptionShort>
